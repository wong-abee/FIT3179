          experiences at school. These are the responses to the question <i>"I have been bullied
          recently at school"</i> from students in year 7 to 9, seperated by Local Government Area (LGA).</p>

        <p>Bullying statistics across Victoria vary greatly, with some correlation to location. In most regions,
          neighbouring LGAs have similar bullying rates and Metropolitan Melbourne has lower rates than in Regional
          Victoria.
          However, in 2016, the LGA with the highest reported rate (30.5%), Northern Grampians near the western border,
          is directly adjacent to the LGA with the lowest rate (Southern Grampians, 4.3%). </p>
